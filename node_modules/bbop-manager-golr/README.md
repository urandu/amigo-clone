# bbop-manager-golr

Manager for handling communication and callbacks with GOlr instances. 

Uses the new abstract managers.

# Documentation

This is a very recent port to a new set of modern managers (able to be used in Node and the browser, in both synchronous and asynchronous modes). While the initializations are a little different (please see the unit tests), the API is pretty much the same. Until we can update the documentation, please see the API docs of the pre-port version [here](https://github.com/berkeleybop/bbop-js).
