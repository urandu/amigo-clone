  "readme": "snap-points-2d\n==============\nRuns iterative snap rounding on a set of 2D coordinates to produce a hierarchical level of detail for optimizing online rendering of huge 2D plots.\n\n# Install\n\n```\nnpm i snap-points-2d\n```\n\n# API\n\n#### `var hlod = require('snap-points-2d')(points, output, outputIds[, bounds])`\nReorders the points hierarchically such that those which are drawn at the same pixel coordinate are grouped together.\n\n* `points` is an array of 2*n values\n* `output` is the reordered array of points\n* `outputIds` is the index of the reordered points in the input array\n* `bounds` is an optional array of 4 values giving the bounding box of the points\n\n**Returns** An array of LOD scales.  Each record is an object with the following properties:\n\n* `pixelSize` the pixel size of this level of detail in data units\n* `offset` the offset of this lod within the output array\n* `count` the number of items in the lod\n\n**Note** the points in `output` are rescaled to the unit box `[0,1]x[0,1]` and the array `points` in the input is shuffled during execution.\n\n# License\n(c) 2015 Mikola Lysenko.
