  "readme": "filtered-vector\n===============\nApplies cubic smoothing to a vector valued curve.  This is useful for smoothing out inputs from the mouse or other input devices.\n\n# Example\n\n```javascript\nvar now = require('right-now')\nvar filterVector = require('filtered-vector')\nvar smoothPosition = filterVector([256, 256])\n\nvar canvas = document.createElement('canvas')\ncanvas.width = 512\ncanvas.height = 512\ndocument.body.appendChild(canvas)\nvar context = canvas.getContext('2d')\n\ncanvas.addEventListener('mousemove', function(ev) {\n  smoothPosition.push(now(), ev.x, ev.y)\n})\n\nfunction paint() {\n  requestAnimationFrame(paint)\n  var t = now()\n  context.fillStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,1)'\n  context.fillRect(0,0,512,512)\n  \n  context.strokeStyle = '#0f0'\n  context.lineWidth = 1\n  context.beginPath()\n  var x = smoothPosition.curve(t)\n  context.moveTo(x[0], x[1])\n  for(var i=0; i<2000; ++i) {\n    var y = smoothPosition.curve(Math.floor(t - i))\n    context.lineTo(y[0], y[1])\n  }\n  context.stroke()\n}\npaint()\n```\n\n[Try out the demo in your browser.](https://mikolalysenko.github.io/filtered-vector)\n\n# Install\n\n```\nnpm i filtered-vector\n```\n\n# API\n\n## Constructor\n\n#### `var vec = require('filtered-vector')(initState[, initVelocity, initTime])`\nCreates a new smoothed vector with the given initial state, velocity and time.\n\n* `initState` is the initial state of the vector\n* `initVelocity` is the initial velocity of the vector\n* `initTime` is the initial time of the vector\n\n**Returns** A new smoothed vector valued curve\n\n## Methods\n\n#### `vec.curve(t)`\nComputes the value of the curve at time `t`\n\n* `t` is the time parameter to sample the curve\n\n**Returns** The value of the curve at time `t`\n\n#### `vec.dcurve(t)`\nComputes the derivative of the curve at time `t`\n\n* `t` is the time parameter\n\n**Returns** The derivative of the curve at time `t`\n\n#### `vec.bounds`\nA pair of arrays giving the upper and lower bounds on the constraints of the vector.  Default is `[-Infinity,-Infinity, ...]` and `[Infinity,Infinity,...]`\n\n#### `vec.push(t, ...)`\nAdds a new data point onto the end of the curve\n\n* `t` is the time the new data point was sampled\n* `...` are the components of the curve vector\n\n#### `vec.move(t, ...)`\nIncrementally moves the curve from the last sampled position by an offset.  This is useful with input devices that emit relative motion (for example scrolling, key press events, pointer lock)\n\n* `t` is the time at which the move event occured\n* `...` are the components of the relative motion\n\n#### `vec.set(t, ...)`\nSets the state of the curve at time `t`\n\n* `t` is the time parameter to sample\n* `...` are the components of the state\n\n#### `vec.jump(t, ...)`\nSets the state of the vector at time `t` with no smoothing.\n\n* `t` is the time parameter to sample\n* `...` are the components of the vector\n\n#### `vec.idle(t)`\nAdds a stationary data point to the curve (ie notify the curve that no input state has changed)\n\n* `t` is the time at which the curve was idle\n\n#### `vec.flush(t)`\nRemoves all samples in the buffer before time `t`\n\n* `t` is the cutoff time\n\n#### `vec.lastT()`\n\n**Returns** The time of the last sample in the curve\n\n#### `vec.stable()`\n\n**Returns** `true` is the vector is stationary as of the last event.\n\n# License\n(c) 2015 Mikola Lysenko.
