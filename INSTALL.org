* AmiGO 2 deployment.
  A big change is that AmiGO 2 is now setup so that:

  - for development, it can be run as it stands using amigo-runner
  - using a proper web server, it can (should) be run directly out of
    the repo.

** URL Mapping
  
   To help keep track, here is the basic mapping table.

   | path          | url                    |
   |---------------+------------------------|
   | \/            | ???                    |
   | static/images | STATIC_URL/images      |
   | static/css    | STATIC_URL/css         |
   | static/js     | STATIC_URL/js          |
   | staging       | STATIC_URL/javascript  |
   | perl/bin/*    | DYNAMIC_URL/*/DISPATCH |


   Where STATIC_URL and DYNAMIC_URL are...
