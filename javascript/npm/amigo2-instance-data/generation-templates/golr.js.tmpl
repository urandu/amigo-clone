/* 
 * Package: golr.js
 * 
 * Namespace: amigo.data.golr
 * 
 * This package was automatically created during an AmiGO 2 installation
 * from the YAML configuration files that AmiGO pulls in.
 *
 * Useful information about GOlr. See the package <golr_conf.js>
 * for the API to interact with this data file.
 *
 * NOTE: This file is generated dynamically at installation time.
 * Hard to work with unit tests--hope it's not too bad. You have to
 * occasionally copy back to keep the unit tests sane.
 *
 * NOTE: This file has a slightly different latout from the YAML
 * configurations files--in addition instead of the fields
 * being in lists (fields), they are in hashes keyed by the
 * field id (fields_hash).

/*
 * Variable: golr
 * 
 * The configuration for the data.
 * Essentially a JSONification of the OWLTools YAML files.
 * This should be consumed directly by <bbop.golr.conf>.
