* Data generating scripts (generate_*_.statistics.js)

These scripts were created to drive plotting software a la gnuplot.

Due to the complexity of making a graph just-so and all of the little
tweaks necessary to the data in certain cases, we finally split the
generators into different files. However, they all share the same
first part of the file for the sake of ease of change and
comformity. Once we settle more into a server-oriented routine and
library setup we'll abstract the first parts out into a standard
library for generating graph data, but until then we'll keep them
completely in sync using meld or similar.

** generate_simple_slice_statistics.js

   Usage like:
   - generate_simple_slice_statistics.js source
   - generate_simple_slice_statistics.js assigned_by
   - generate_simple_slice_statistics.js evidence

     The first two examples are obvious when you see the output. The
     last example looks at the evidence facet, but only the items in
     the order as listed.
